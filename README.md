# Project Background
Jumpstart is a fictional SaaS company that sells marketing and sales software packages to other businesses. In operation since 2015, Jumpstart has continued to expand its software offerings and has reached customers from many different industries and countries around the world. 

The company has collected data on the orders placed, order revenue, and customer location and industry over the course of 4 years. This project thoroughly analyzes this data to provide actionable insights that Jumpstart can use to improve their business model.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Revenue & Growth:** Evaluate historical sales trends with a focus on Revenue, Number of Orders, and Average Order Value
- **Monthly Sales Trends:** An analysis of monthly sales trends
- **Product Performance:** Assess product sales and profit, focusing on year-over-year (YoY) growth
- **Regional Sales:** Analysis of orders placed and popular products per region

The SQL queries used for this analysis can be found here [[link](https://github.com/ashivercoding/JumpstartSalesProject/blob/main/Jumpstart%20SQL%20Analysis.sql)].

An interactive Tableau dashboard used to report and explore sales trends can be found here [[link](https://public.tableau.com/views/JumpstartSalesDashboards/Revenue?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)].

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
