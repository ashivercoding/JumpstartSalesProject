# Insights Deep Dive
### Monthly Sales Trends:

* **Sales are typically above average in September, November, and December.** Sales hit an all-time peak in November 2023 with 447 orders totaling $112,326.47 in revenue. This is likely attributed to the holiday sales spike and end-of-year push that is experienced globally.
  
* On average, September, November, and December account for **approximately 43%** of all orders placed each year. This corresponds with the spike in sales seen during those months. Alternatively, January and February only account for 6.7% of all orders.

* March 2023 saw a 707% increase in profit compared to the previous month. This can be attributed to **5 purchases of the Alchemy software that made up 60%** of the total profit for that month.
  
* January, April, and July consistently experience a reduction in profit compared to the previous month.

### Product Performance:

* **4 products account for 57% of Jumpstart's revenue:** Contact Matcher, FinanceHub, Site Analytics, and Marketing Suite - Gold. However, these products only account for 38% of the company's total profit. In 2023, they generated $408K in Revenue but only $29K in profit, 32% of the company's total.
